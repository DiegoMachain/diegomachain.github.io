In this project, we developed an application to change the arrangement of furniture in a scan of a room using scene graphs. We worked exensively with meshes to manipulate vertices conrresponding to individual objects. We also addressed various challenges, such as mesh fixing due to imperfect scans, object collisions, texture management, and managing object relationships between objects. The development was relying heavily on Trimesh and Open3d packages.

Using this tool, you can create different layouts of the same room and evaluate the most practical or the best looking arrengements.
