The simulation of complex systems can sometimes take a very long time to implement, that is why creating a neural network to solve simulations can be a good alternative.
The objective of this project was to solve the one-dimensional heat equation with a feedforward dense neural network with tunable parameters and trianing points:

With the boundary conditions:

In order to solve this system of equations we need to create a two-outputs neural network (t, x). In my case I used four layers and 20 neurons in each layer. After this we need to have representing points, which are called sobol points for the interior and the boundaries. In my case I created 256 interior sobol points, 64 temporal and 64 spatial boundary sobol points.
Then we need to apply initial and boundary conditions based on the system of equations. The computation of the residuals from our prediction and the real equations systems helps us to estimate the loss function.

I trained my Neural Network and I obtained the following results:
