I am currently working on this project as my master thesis in collaboration with the Structural Mechanics at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC), and the Fabrication and Material Awera Architecture (FMAA), and the supervisors are Dr. Konstantinos Tatsis, Dr. Luis Salamanca, and Ping-Hsun Tsai, respectively.

This project aims to develop an ML-based design and fabrication workflow for a robotic on-site plastering process â€“ a real-world application. For this, data is collected during the robotic plastering process by a 3D depth camera, comprising the fabrication parameters (i.e., velocity and distance of spraying) as well as the acquired surface geometry.

The objective of this project is to be able to consider the effect of the spraying gun on the wall and with this implemnet a motion planning model. The first part is being studying with Physics based Graph Neural Networks, where some testing trajectories are being implemented and predictions in the future are being generated. The results we are having so far seem promesing, the next image is an example of a prediction of 5 layers in the future by following a trajectory of spraying:
