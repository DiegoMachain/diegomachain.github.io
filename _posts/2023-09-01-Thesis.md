I am currently working on this project as my master thesis in collaboration with the Structural Mechanics at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC), and the Fabrication and Material Awera Architecture (FMAA). I'm under the supervision of Dr. Konstantinos Tatsis, Dr. Luis Salamanca, and Ping-Hsun Tsai.

This project aims to develop an ML-based design and fabrication workflow for a robotic on-site plastering process, a real-world application. For this, data is collected during the robotic plastering process by a 3D depth camera, comprising the fabrication parameters (i.e., velocity and distance of spraying) as well as the acquired surface geometry.

The objective of this project is to understand how the spraying gun affects the wall, and with this implement a motion planning model. The first part is being studying with Physics based Graph Neural Networks, where some testing trajectories are being implemented to meshes and predictions in the future of the mesh are then generated. The preliminary results appear promising, the next image is an example of a prediction of 5 layers in the future by following a trajectory of spraying, in the left you can see the ground truth layer and on the right the prediction on the wall:
