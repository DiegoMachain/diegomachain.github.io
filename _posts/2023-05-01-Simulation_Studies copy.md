I conducted simulations involving an electron lens designed for the Future Circular Collider at CERN. The primary objective of these simulations was to assess the impact of these lenses on the beams within the collider. The advantages offered by these colliders include the compensation of beam-beam effects, Landau damping, and collimation for halo particles. 


In general, an electron lens is characterized as a low energy electron beam, which can interact with hadron beams. Electron guns are used to generate the electron beams. The impacts of the electron lens also depend on the distribution of the incident beam.

Some findings during this research project include a study about the noise introduced by misalignment of the proton beam and the e-leans produces an increasement of the emittance. Another discovery was some working parameters were inside instability regions, so they should be avoided.
