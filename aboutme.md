My name is Diego Machain and I am currently a M.Sc. student at ETH Zurich. The field I'm studying is Computational Science and Engineering with a specialization on robotics. My main areas of interests are computer vision, machine learning and deep AI.


My other insterests, like the majority of people living in Switzerland, are mountain biking, hiking and skiing.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
